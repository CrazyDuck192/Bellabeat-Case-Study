## Introduction <a id="introduction"></a>
This is Bellabeat data analysis case study as final project of [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program]("https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics"). Bellabeat company was founded in 2014 and specialises on creating health-focused smart products for women. During this case study we will go through all data analysis steps: ask, prepare, process, analyse, share and act and research user patterns and habits of using Bellabeat's devices to suggest ways to improve user experience and products sales.

## ü§îAsk <a id="ask"></a>
Every analysis starts with problem statement: our main goal is to increase sales of Bellabeat's smart devices. And to reach this goal we should go through the following milestones:
* find patterns, trends of smart device usage and user indicators
* create visualisations of trends found during the analysis
* based on the insights found pitch ideas or recommendations to improve the user experience of using smart devices

## üõ¢Ô∏èPrepare <a id="prepare"></a>
Data we will use for analysis taken from [Kaggle: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) and consists of 29 csv files divided by two periods (march-april and april-may) with information about 30 users smart device usage. But what about integrity and quality of data? To answer this question we can use ROCCC rule:
- R for Reliable: data has a bunch of issues:
    - data was collected from 30 users but tables with data about users daily activity contain more than 30 unique user id and other tables contain less than 30 unique user id;
    - in tables with data about users daily activity every user has different number of records;
    - there is no table with daily sleep data for the march-april period (but this table exists for april-may period);
    - table with daily sleep data for april-may period contains repetitions.
  
  so our data is not reliable;
-  O for Original: dataset was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk and then was uploaded on Kaggle. So it may be changed and we don't have an access to the original data source. Therefore data is not original;
-  C for Comprehensive: data contains a lot of users indicators such as physical activity, sleep time, heart rate, weight and their minute-by-minute, hourly, daily meaurements. Therefore this dataset is comprehensive;
-  C for Current: data was collected in 2016 and since that time overall picture may have changed. Dataset is not current;
-  C for Cited: Unknown
## ‚öôÔ∏èProcess <a id="process"></a>
First of all, let's combine tables with relevant data from different periods together in the following way:
``` SQL
/*
hourly_steps_total
*/
-- add new column to specify period of records
ALTER TABLE hourly_steps_march_april
ADD COLUMN period VARCHAR(255);

UPDATE hourly_steps_march_april
SET period = "march-april";


ALTER TABLE hourly_steps_april_may
ADD COLUMN period VARCHAR(255);

UPDATE hourly_steps_april_may
SET period = "april-may";

-- combine two tables into one
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS hourly_steps_total AS (
	SELECT * FROM hourly_steps_march_april
    UNION 
    SELECT * FROM hourly_steps_april_may
);

-- parse date and cast to datetime type
UPDATE hourly_steps_total
SET ActivityHour = STR_TO_DATE(ActivityHour, "%m/%d/%Y %h:%i:%s %p");

ALTER TABLE hourly_steps_total
MODIFY ActivityHour DATETIME;
```
Tables "hourly_calories_total", "hourly_intensity_total", "daily_activity_total" were created in the same way.

<br>

We don't have table with users daily sleep data so we need to create it:
``` SQL
/*
daily_sleep_total
*/
UPDATE minute_sleep_march_april
SET date = STR_TO_DATE(date, "%m/%d/%Y %h:%i:%s %p");

-- create table to summarise sleep time of every user
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS daily_sleep_march_april AS (
	SELECT 
		Id,
		date AS SleepDay,
		COUNT(*) AS TotalSleepRecords,
		SUM(minutesAsleep) AS TotalMinutesAsleep,
		SUM(timeInBed) AS TotalTimeInBed,
        "march-april" AS period
	FROM (
		SELECT 
			Id, 
			DATE(date) AS date,
			COUNT(*) AS minutesAsleep,
			logId
		FROM minute_sleep_march_april
		WHERE value = 1
		GROUP BY Id, DATE(date), logId
	) sleep_time
	JOIN (
		SELECT 
			Id,
			DATE(date) AS date,
			COUNT(*) AS timeInBed,
			logId
		FROM minute_sleep_march_april
		GROUP BY Id, DATE(date), logId
	) bed_time
	USING (Id, date, logId)
	GROUP BY Id, date
);
```

And then we can combine tables with users daily sleep data together:
``` SQL
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS daily_sleep_total AS (
	SELECT * FROM daily_sleep_march_april
    UNION
    SELECT * FROM daily_sleep_april_may
);
```
<br>

To create table with sleep time by days of week we will use the following query:
``` SQL
/*
average_sleep_by_weekdays
*/
-- create table to find average sleep time by days of week
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS average_sleep_by_weekdays AS (
	SELECT 
		DAYNAME(SleepDay) AS WeekDay, 
		AVG(TotalMinutesAsleep) AS AverageMinutesAsleep
	FROM daily_sleep_total
	GROUP BY DAYNAME(SleepDay)
	ORDER BY AverageMinutesAsleep DESC
);
```
<br>

And to create table with number of days user slept less than 7 hours (bad sleep) we will use the following query:
``` SQL
/*
bad_sleep_total
*/
-- create table to find for every user number of days 
-- when he/she slept less than 7 hours
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS bad_sleep_total AS (
	SELECT 
		Id, 
		period,
		COUNT(*) AS days
	FROM daily_sleep_total
	WHERE TotalMinutesAsleep < 420
	GROUP BY Id, period
);
```

## üîéAnalyse <a id="analyse"></a>
### Setup

First of all, we need to load all required libraries we will use to
analyze and visualize data.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(ggalt)
library(cowplot)
```

### Importing data

To start working with data we need to import all datasets we will use
for analysis (all datasets were created using SQL on step ‚ÄúProcess‚Äù of
case study project). We won‚Äôt use data about weight and heart rate due
to small user samples of these datasets.

``` r
daily_activity_total <- read.csv('prepared_data/daily_activity_total.csv')

hourly_intensity_total <- read.csv('prepared_data/hourly_intensity_total.csv')

hourly_steps_total <- read.csv('prepared_data/hourly_steps_total.csv')

hourly_calories_total <- read.csv('prepared_data/hourly_calories_total.csv')

daily_sleep_total <- read.csv('prepared_data/daily_sleep_total.csv')

average_sleep_by_weekdays <- read.csv('prepared_data/average_sleep_by_weekdays.csv')

bad_sleep_total <- read.csv('prepared_data/bad_sleep_total.csv')
```

### Data overview

Before starting the analysis, let‚Äôs look at the datasets we have.

``` r
head(daily_activity_total, 10)
```

### Analysis

Now we can start our main part of analysis. We will research two aspects
of user data: user activity and user sleep.

Let‚Äôs start with exploring number of steps users walk everyday:

``` r
# create scatter plot with trend line for daily activity
daily_activity_total %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = TotalSteps, y = Calories, colour = period)) +
  geom_point(size = 1) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(linetype = ''), 
              se = FALSE, color = '#ff5959') +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('march-april' = '#57abff', 
                                'april-may' = '#304bff'), 
                     name = 'Periods') + 
  scale_linetype(name = "Trend line") + theme_bw() +
  labs(x = 'Steps',
       title = 'Relationship between number of steps and burned calories per day')
```

![00001](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/970e637a-8f56-4b94-b433-16465f3f6fe7)

We can see strong relationship between number of steps and number of
burned calories per day. This fact is pretty obvious but now we can see
it clearly. And what about this relationship during the day by hours?

``` r
# create line plot for steps
steps_plot <- hourly_steps_total %>%
  # group by hour of day and period
  group_by(time_hour = hour(ActivityHour), period) %>% 
  summarise(steps = mean(StepTotal)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = 
           aes(x = time_hour, y = steps, group = period, 
              colour = period)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_xspline() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('march-april' = '#57abff', 
                                'april-may' = '#304bff'), name = 'Periods') + 
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL,
       title = '',
       subtitle = 'Average number of steps during a day')


# create line plot for calories
calories_plot <- hourly_calories_total %>%
  # group by hour of day and period
  group_by(time_hour = hour(ActivityHour), period) %>%
  summarise(calories = mean(Calories)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = calories, 
                       group = period, color = period)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_xspline() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('march-april' = '#57abff', 
                                'april-may' = '#304bff'), name = 'Period') +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, 
       subtitle = 'Average number of burned calories during a day')


# display both charts together to compare them
plot_grid(steps_plot, calories_plot, nrow = 2)
```

![00002](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e09e7277-e41c-4daf-b492-c8f7bd5612e0)

And here we can see how similar these patterns are. So thanks to these
charts we made sure that walking is important to burn calories.

But what about real number of steps users walk everyday in average?

``` r
# group records by user Id to find average number of steps of every user
daily_activity_grouped <- daily_activity_total %>%
  group_by(Id) %>%
  summarise(average_steps = mean(TotalSteps))

# create bar plot for average number of steps of every user
daily_activity_grouped %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = reorder(as.character(Id), average_steps), 
                       y = average_steps, 
                       fill = average_steps > 6000)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = 'dodge') +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('FALSE' = '#ff5959', 'TRUE' = '#304bff'), 
                    name = 'Steps > 6000') +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = 'Average number of steps',
       title = "Average number of steps each user walk per day")
```

![00003](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/281c000e-b1a1-49a6-a17a-5d2c0d6cec32)

``` r
# total number of users
length(daily_activity_grouped$average_steps)
```

    ## [1] 35

``` r
# number of users who walk less than 6000 steps per day in average
sum(daily_activity_grouped$average_steps < 6000)
```

    ## [1] 14

We can see that 14 of 35 users walk less than 6000 steps per day in
average (when it is recommended to walk at least 6000-8000 steps per
day).

Next, let‚Äôs review user‚Äôs activity at the whole. We will start with time
distributions of different activity types by days of week:

``` r
# create bar plot for every intensity type
daily_activity_total %>%
  group_by(week_day = wday(ActivityDate, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE, 
                           week_start = 1, locale = 'English')) %>%
  # summarize by every type of intensity
  summarise(very_active = mean(VeryActiveMinutes),
            fairly_active = mean(FairlyActiveMinutes),
            lightly_active = mean(LightlyActiveMinutes)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c('very_active', 'fairly_active', 'lightly_active'),
               names_to = 'intensity', values_to = 'minutes') %>%
  transform(
    # order intensity types from top to bottom within legend
    intensity = factor(intensity, 
                       levels = c('lightly_active',
                                  'fairly_active',
                                  'very_active'),
                       labels = c('Lightly active',
                                  'Fairly active',
                                  'Very active'))) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = week_day, y = minutes, fill = intensity)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = 'dodge') + 
  facet_grid(rows = vars(intensity), scales = 'free') + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('Lightly active' = '#52c5ff',
                               'Fairly active' = '#5294ff',
                               'Very active' = '#0f73ff'), name = 'Intensities') + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = 'Minutes',
       title = 'Time of different intensity types')
```

![00004](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6ce6845-0cd3-40b3-b9cd-5da90978e116)

As we can see, average time of lightly active intensity per day is
around 180-190 minutes, average time of fairly active intensity is
around 13-14 minutes and time of very active time is around 19-20
minutes.

Let‚Äôs research relationships between intensity time and other
statistics:

``` r
# merge calories dataset and intensity dataset to
# create scatter plot with trend line
merge(x = hourly_calories_total, 
      y = hourly_intensity_total, 
      by.x = c('Id', 'ActivityHour', 'period'),
      by.y = c('Id', 'ActivityHour', 'period')) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Calories, y = TotalIntensity, colour = period)) +
  geom_point(size = 1) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(linetype = ''), se = FALSE, color = '#ff5959') +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('march-april' = '#57abff','april-may' = '#304bff'),
                     name = 'Periods') + 
  scale_linetype(name = "Trend line") + theme_bw() +
  labs(x = 'Calories', y = 'Intensity value',
       title = 'Relationship between burned calories and intensity value')
```

![00005](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44a35927-0a15-468e-9914-447f108b4662)

Quite obvious that there is positive correlation between intensity time
and number of burned calories per hour.

``` r
# merge daily sleep dataset and hourly intensity dataset together
# to create scatter plot with trend line
merge(x = daily_sleep_total %>% transform(SleepDay = date(SleepDay)),
      y = hourly_intensity_total %>% 
        group_by(Id, activity_day = date(ActivityHour), period) %>%
        summarise(total_intensity = sum(TotalIntensity)),
      by.x = c('Id', 'SleepDay', 'period'),
      by.y = c('Id', 'activity_day', 'period')) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = TotalMinutesAsleep, y = total_intensity, 
                       colour = period, group = 1)) +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(linetype = ''), 
              se = FALSE, color = '#ff5959') +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('march-april' = '#57abff', 
                                'april-may' = '#304bff'), 
                     name = 'Periods') + 
  scale_linetype(name = "Trend line") + theme_bw() +
  labs(x = 'Minutes asleep',
       y = 'Intensity value',
       title = 'Relationship between sleep time and intensity value')
```

![00006](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a42f691a-c54b-4aee-9df5-b8e3daae95fe)

Not so obvious: there is no correlation between intensity time and sleep
time.

``` r
# merge daily sleep dataset and daily activity dataset together 
# to create scatter plot with trend line
merge(x = daily_sleep_total,
      y = daily_activity_total,
      by.x = c('Id', 'SleepDay', 'period'),
      by.y = c('Id', 'ActivityDate', 'period')) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = SedentaryMinutes, y = TotalMinutesAsleep, colour = period)) +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(linetype = ''), 
              se = FALSE, color = '#ff5959') +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('march-april' = '#57abff', 
                                'april-may' = '#304bff'), 
                     name = 'Periods') + 
  scale_linetype(name = "Trend line") + theme_bw() +
  labs(x = 'Sedentary minutes',
       y = 'Minutes asleep',
       title = 'Relationship between sleep time and sedentary time, minutes')
```

![00007](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30bd5e27-1992-41a8-b669-822dbef1d2cb)

And here we can see an interesting trend: there is negative correlation
between sleep time and sedentary time. Thus we can say that spending
less time sitting can improve user‚Äôs sleep.

But how users really sleep? Let‚Äôs answer this question:

``` r
# create bar plot for sleep time by days of week
average_sleep_by_weekdays %>% 
  transform(WeekDay = wday(1:7, label = TRUE, 
                           abbr = FALSE, locale = 'English')) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = WeekDay, y = AverageMinutesAsleep)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = '#4f85ff') + theme_bw() +
  labs(x = NULL, y = 'Minutes',
       title = 'Average sleep time, minutes')
```

![00008](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/089ebb26-b464-4644-9a8f-7bda90d65a47)

In average users sleep longer on weekends and most of the week they
sleep less than 7 hours (which is minimum recommended sleep time).

``` r
# group records by user Id to find average sleep time of every user
daily_sleep_grouped <- daily_sleep_total %>%
  group_by(Id) %>%
  summarise(average_sleep_minutes = mean(TotalMinutesAsleep))

# create bar plot for average sleep time by user
daily_sleep_grouped %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = reorder(as.character(Id), average_sleep_minutes), 
                       y = average_sleep_minutes, 
                       fill = average_sleep_minutes >= 420)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = 'dodge') +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('FALSE' = '#ff5959', 'TRUE' = '#304bff'), 
                    name = 'Sleep time, minutes >= 420') + theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = 'Average sleep time',
       title = "Average sleep time of every user, minutes")
```

![00009](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07454a6d-a579-4921-8603-d14a2331adc4)

``` r
# total number of users
length(daily_sleep_grouped$average_sleep_minutes)
```

    ## [1] 25

``` r
# number of users who sleep less than 7 hours per day in average
sum(daily_sleep_grouped$average_sleep_minutes < 420)
```

    ## [1] 17

Most of the users sleep less than 7 hours in average! Some of them even
sleep less than 3 hours! This requires special attention but we need
more data for deeper analysis.

``` r
# create bar plot for number of bad sleep days 
# (when user sleeps less than 7 hours) by days of week
merge(bad_sleep_total,
      bad_sleep_total %>% group_by(Id) %>% summarise(total_days = sum(days)), 
      by = c('Id')) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = reorder(as.character(Id), -total_days), 
                       y = days, fill = period)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('march-april' = '#59a7ff', 
                               'april-may' = '#4278ff'), 
                    labels = c('march-april', 'april-may'),
                    name = 'Periods') + theme_bw() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = 'Number of days', 
       title = "Number of days each user slept less than 7 hours")
```

![00010](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49d0b604-65d1-4771-9caa-0c6d00ad8474)

And here we can see that some of the users most of the days slept less
than 7 hours per day. Lack of sleep can be serious problem so this
situation requires special attention.

## üßêAct <a id="act"></a>
Conclusions and findings based on the analysis:
- walking and physical activity is important to burn more calories per day
- the most active period of day is from 10 to 18 hours
- more than 1/3 of users walk less than 6000 steps which is the minimal recommended number of steps
- more than 80% of time users spend sedentary
- 2/3 of users sleep less than 7 hours per day in average
- decreasing sedentary time can lead to better sleep
<br/>

Recommendations based on conclusions to improve user experience:
- organise campaigns to promote ways to improve health such as advice to increase sleep time or time of physical activity
- create reminders for number of steps per day (with minimal required number of steps user must walk every day) and sleep time
- send notification if user spends a lot of time in a row sedentary or notification to fall asleep earlier if user didn't get enough sleep this night or if it takes a long time to fall asleep
- collect more data from more users to make more effective analysis and provide more confident results
- provide loyal customers discounts on products and membership
